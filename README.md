# Langtons_Ant
Langton's Ant cellular automaton written in Processing

Cell class is based on the Cell class in "The Nature of Code" by Daniel Shiffman

**To Use:** download the processing IDE from processing.org and add the program folder to your sketchbook folder and then open/run from the IDE

The "ant" starts at a random location at start and every time the canvas is clicked with the mouse 

As the "ant" moves its previous locations will begin to fade into a different cell color and eventually it will break free to create a "highway" eventually the "ant' will wrap around the canvas and collide with its original paths

Enjoy!
